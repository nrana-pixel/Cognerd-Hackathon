Based on this company's specific business model and target market, identify ONLY direct competitors that:
1. Offer the SAME type of products/services (not just retailers that sell them)
2. Target the SAME customer segment
3. Have a SIMILAR business model (e.g., if it's a DTC brand, find other DTC brands)
4. Actually compete for the same customers
5. If a location is provided, prioritize competitors from the same city/region and same country; include at least 4 from that country/region if possible.

For example:
- If it's a DTC underwear brand, find OTHER DTC underwear brands (not department stores)
- If it's a web scraping API, find OTHER web scraping APIs (not general data tools)
- If it's an AI model provider, find OTHER AI model providers (not AI applications)

IMPORTANT:
- Only include companies you are confident actually exist
- If a location is available, ensure at least 4 competitors are from the same country/region; prefer city/region matches when possible
- Focus on TRUE competitors with similar offerings
- Exclude retailers, marketplaces, or aggregators unless the company itself is one
- Aim for 10-15 competitors total
